## Notes:
You can use free RPC for lightweight project. Eg: have auto withdrawal function which transfer token to user wallet address.

## What is ChainID?
ChainID is a ID that differentiate the blockchain. As we know, BSC chain is forked from ETH chain. So, there have different ChainID.
* ETH mainnet: 1
* ETH Gerli testnet: 5
* BSC mainnet: 56
* BSC testnet: 97
* Polygon Mainnet: 137

You need to ensure to use correct ChainID when you do JSON-RPC call.
